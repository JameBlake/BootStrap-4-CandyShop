### __What is the CandyShop site?__

The CandyShop website was created in one of Colt Steele's classes on Udemy. It was a fantastic code along which introduced me to BootStrap 4.

The main purposes was to learn the new class names introduced in Bootstrap 4 and to show that Bootstrap websites can look unique and not too "Bootstrappy".
